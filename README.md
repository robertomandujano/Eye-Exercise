# Eye-Exercise
* For this exercise, a webpage will be created that includes two eyes that follow the movement of your mouse. This is done by utilizing mouse events such as "mousemove" to bind the document object model elements to events. 

How to run

* Download the files from the Eye-Exercise repository, save them to a folder, and drag and drop the index.html file onto an empty webpage. Once the webpage has been populated, move your cursor to the location you would like the eyes to look at.

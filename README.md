# Eye-Exercise
* For this exercise, a webpage will be created that includes two eyes that follow the movement of your mouse. This is done by utilizing mouse events such as "mousemove" to bind the document object model elements to events. 
How to run
* Download the files from the Eye-Exercise repository, save them to a folder, and drag and drop the PacMen.html file onto an empty webpage. Once the webpage has been populated click on the "Add PacMan" button to add one PacMan per click and then "Start Game" to make the PacMen move at their own pace. Note, for every time the "Start Game" button is clicked the PacMen will move at a quicker pace.
